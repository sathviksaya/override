## Idea
We had an idea that if one user can add an event or series of events and share those with all the user(s), who signs up for that topic, can easily manage all their work and not miss any grouped events. If at least one user remembers and adds up an event, can notify all other users. So, we developed the app as an Pub/Sub Architecture model.

This app aims to sync events and timings among group of people. The app can be made use in many scenarios, ex: Classroom events or deadlines, Work place events, Gathering events etc, where multiple people can track the timing of an event added by a single person.

## Future scope
The next version of Shareminder is aimed to have features like adding & deleting the events to & from Google Calendar, having multiple admins in a group, filtering the events and groups, notifications for events if chosen by the user to do so etc.
