## Idea
We had an idea that if one user can add an event or series of events and share those with all the user(s), who sign's up for that topic, can easily manage all their work and not miss any grouped events. If at least one user remembers and adds up an event, can notify all other users. So, we developed the app as an Pub/Sub Architecture model.
